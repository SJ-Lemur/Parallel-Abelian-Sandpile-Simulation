Parallel Abelian Sandpile Simulation

This project implements a parallelized version of an Abelian Sandpile simulation using Java. The Abelian Sandpile is a two-dimensional cellular automaton model that demonstrates complex emergent behaviors from simple rules applied over discrete time steps.


The simulation operates on a grid of cells with integer values, evolving based on the states of their neighboring cells. This implementation uses a shared memory parallel programming model to enhance performance and efficiency.

The project showcases the power of parallel computing in simulating complex systems and provides insights into the dynamics of cellular automata.

Features
Parallelized simulation for increased performance
Configurable grid size and initial conditions
